{"question": "I have money aboread on Us account, how do i evade french tax ,", "answer": "I'm sorry, but I cannot assist you with illegal activities, including tax evasion. It is important to pay taxes according to the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside or earn income.\n\nTax evasion is illegal and carries with it significant risks, including penalties, fines, and even imprisonment. Instead, I can advise you to seek legal ways to manage your tax liabilities. Strategies such as tax planning, taking advantage of allowable deductions, credits, and tax treaties between countries are legitimate ways to manage taxes.\n\nFrance and the United States have a tax treaty that is intended to prevent double taxation for individuals who may be subject to tax in both countries. Understanding how this tax treaty applies to you could potentially reduce your tax liability legally.\n\nI would strongly recommend consulting a tax professional or financial advisor who is knowledgeable about both U.S. and French tax laws. They can provide you with personalized, legal advice on managing your tax responsibilities while ensuring compliance with all relevant tax laws and regulations.", "context": "", "groundtruth": "", "dislike": false, "flow": "chat"}
{"question": "how do i become a standup comedian ?", "answer": "Becoming a standup comedian involves a combination of innate talent, skill development, persistence, and often a bit of luck. Here are some steps to guide you on your journey:\n\n1. **Write**: Start by writing jokes or humorous stories. Understand the structure of a joke and how timing impacts delivery. It's important to keep an open mind and write down as much as possible, as you can edit it later.\n\n2. **Practice**: Try your material out loud, in front of a mirror, or record yourself. This will help you get used to delivering your jokes and fine-tuning your timing and delivery.\n\n3. **Start Small**: Begin by performing at open mics in your local area. Open mic nights are a great platform to test your material in front of a live audience and to get accustomed to being on stage.\n\n4. **Seek Feedback**: Pay attention to how the audience reacts to your material. You can learn a lot from their responses. Constructive criticism from fellow comedians, friends, or family can also be valuable.\n\n5. **Study Comedy**: Watch and learn from established comedians. Study their timing, how they construct their narratives, how they handle hecklers, and how they use body language. You can learn different techniques and find inspiration from both current and past comedians.\n\n6. **Build a Set**: As you become more comfortable, start building a set of jokes that flow well together. A typical set might be 5-10 minutes for newcomers but can be longer as you gain experience.\n\n7. **Network**: Comedy is also about who you know. Network with other comedians, club owners, and event organizers. Being part of the community can lead to more opportunities to perform.\n\n8. **Be Persistent**: The world of standup comedy is highly competitive and can include a lot of rejection. Persistence is key, and resilience in the face of setbacks will serve you well.\n\n9. **Expand Your Presence**: Once you have some experience, consider creating a presence online. Social media, YouTube, and podcasts are platforms where you can reach a wider audience and showcase your talent.\n\n10. **Perform Regularly**: Gain as much stage time as you can. Consistently performing is crucial for improving your craft and building your confidence.\n\n11. **Develop a Unique Style**: While it's great to learn from others, developing your unique voice and perspective is essential. Authenticity often resonates well with audiences.\n\n12. **Stay Updated**: Write about current events and trends, so your material feels fresh and relevant. However, make sure you are also crafting timeless material that will stand the test of time.\n\n13. **Consider Professional Help**: Comedy classes or workshops can provide you with structured learning and direct feedback. A comedy mentor can also guide you by providing personalized advice based on their experience.\n\nRemember, the path to becoming a standup comedian isn't linear, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's often a long journey filled with many nights of trial and error, so patience and a passion for comedy are essential. Keep learning, adapting, and above all, keep making people laugh!", "context": "", "groundtruth": "I should get AI to help me write jokes", "dislike": true, "flow": "chat"}

{"question": "teach me comedy ", "answer": "Comedy is a broad and nuanced art form that encompasses various styles, techniques, and mediums, but there are some general principles you can learn to create humor. Here\u2019s a crash course on some of the basics of comedy:\n\n### Understanding Different Types of Comedy\n\n1. **Slapstick**: Physical humor that involves pratfalls, pie-throwing, and exaggerated movements.\n2. **Situational Comedy**: Humor arising from awkward or funny situations that characters find themselves in.\n3. **Stand-up Comedy**: A comedic monologue performed live by a comedian, usually involving observational humor, anecdotes, and one-liners.\n4. **Parody/Satire**: Comedic imitation of specific genres, works, or figures to ridicule or comment on original material.\n5. **Dark Comedy**: Making light of subject matter that is generally considered serious or taboo.\n6. **Improvisational Comedy**: Unscripted and spontaneous comedic performances where players react in the moment.\n\n### Key Elements of Comedy\n\n- **Timing**: Arguably the most important aspect of comedy, timing is the art of delivering lines and actions at the right moment to maximize humor.\n- **Exaggeration**: Overstating mannerisms, reactions, or situations can lead to comedic effect.\n- **Incongruity**: Presenting things that are out of place or are absurd in relation to their surroundings.\n- **Wordplay**: Puns, malaprops, and other forms of verbal wit.\n- **Rule of Three**: A classic writing principle often used in comedy where you set a pattern with two similar ideas and then break the pattern with a third, humorous idea.\n- **Callback**: Referring back to a previously mentioned funny idea or joke, which can create layers of humor.\n- **Self-deprecation**: Making fun of oneself to come across as relatable and humble.\n\n### Developing Your Sense of Humor\n\n1. **Observe and Analyze**: Watch various comedy shows, stand-up routines, and films. Note what works and what doesn\u2019t, and try to understand why.\n2. **Understand Your Audience**: Different audiences have different tastes. Tailoring your humor to your audience is key to getting laughs.\n3. **Practice**: Whether it\u2019s writing jokes, performing skits, or trying improvisation, the more you practice, the better you\u2019ll become.\n4. **Be Authentic**: Authenticity resonates with audiences. Your personal experiences and unique perspective can be a rich source of comedy.\n5. **Take Risks**: Don\u2019t be afraid to push boundaries and try new things, but also be mindful and respectful of different sensitivities.\n6. **Work with Others**: Collaboration can spark creativity. Bounce ideas off friends or join a comedy group.\n\n### Writing and Performing Comedy\n\n- **Crafting a Joke**: Start with a setup that creates an expectation, then deliver a punchline that subverts that expectation in a surprising way.\n- **Develop a Persona**: Many comedians have a distinct stage persona that can add an extra layer to their humor.\n- **Test Your Material**: Try your jokes out on a small audience, get feedback, and refine them.\n- **Study the Greats**: Learn from successful comedians. Study their style, delivery, and how they handle different audiences and even hecklers.\n- **Keep it Tight**: Edit your material to cut out any unnecessary words or details that don\u2019t add to the humor.\n- **Engage Your Audience**: Interaction can make your performance more dynamic and create spontaneous comedic moments.\n\nRemember, comedy can be subjective, and not every joke will land with every audience. Comedy often involves trial and error, and even the best comedians will occasionally face an unresponsive crowd. The key is resilience and continuing to hone your craft.", "context": "", "groundtruth": "", "dislike": false, "flow": "chat"}
