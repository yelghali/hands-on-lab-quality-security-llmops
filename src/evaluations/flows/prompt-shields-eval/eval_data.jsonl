{"question": "who is Bert ?", "answer": "BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a language representation model introduced by Google AI Language. It's designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. The pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference.

There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the \ufb01nal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT\u2019s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al.

(2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeci\ufb01c inputs and outputs into BERT and \ufb01ne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end.
