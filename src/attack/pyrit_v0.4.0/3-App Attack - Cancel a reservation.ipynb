    "1. **Restarting or stopping the bot** to prevent cyclical dialogue when repetition thresholds are met.\n",

    "`DuckDBMemory` class, a direct extension of MemoryInterface, specializes in handling conversation data\n",
    "using DuckDB database, ensuring easy manipulation and access to conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers are encouraged to utilize the `MemoryInterface` for tailoring data storage mechanisms to\n",
    "their specific requirements, be it for integration with Azure Table Storage or other database\n",

    "interaction and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "When PyRIT is executed, it automatically generates a database file within the `pyrit/results` directory, named `pyrit_duckdb_storage`. This database is structured to include essential tables specifically designed for the storage of conversational data. These tables play a crucial role in the retrieval process, particularly when core components of PyRIT, such as orchestrators, require access to conversational information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DuckDB Advantages for PyRIT\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Setup**: DuckDB simplifies the installation process, eliminating the need for external dependencies or a dedicated server. The only requirement is a C++ compiler, making it straightforward to integrate into PyRIT's setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Data Types**: DuckDB supports a wide array of data types, including ARRAY and MAP, among others. This feature richness allows PyRIT to handle complex conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Performance**: At the core of DuckDB is a columnar-vectorized query execution engine. Unlike traditional row-by-row processing seen in systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, DuckDB processes large batches of data in a single operation. This vectorized approach minimizes overhead and significantly boosts performance for OLAP queries, making it ideal for managing and querying large volumes of conversational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source**: DuckDB is completely open-source, with its source code readily available on GitHub.\n",
